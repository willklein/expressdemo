expressdemo
===========

A very basic Node.js app written at my live-code session on Node.js w/ Express at Hartford Code Camp 6 on May 18th, 2013.

We set out to write a very simple CRUD app for adding local developer events to a list. The app displays a list of events cached in server memory, and allows for adding new events. The code was written on the fly w/ Q&A from the audience.

I might come back to this in the future to extend it into a more complete demo app. For now it's available to serve as a reference to the code camp attendees.

To run the app, clone it locally, run npm install, and then run app.js in Node.
